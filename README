InSpec (Auditing and Testing Framework)
--------------------------------------

(Adapted from Pat Volkerding's original google-chrome SlackBuild.)

Here's how to install inspec on Slackware.


First, go to the inspec site:

https://downloads.chef.io/inspec

Click the download button for the Ubuntu 16.04 release.


Read and accept the license terms, and download the .deb package.


Then, with the inspec_$RELEASE_amd64.deb package in the same directory
as the inspec.SlackBuild script, run the script as root to
convert the .deb to a Slackware .txz:

RELEASE=2.1.67-1 ./inspec.SlackBuild

Change the RELEASE value to the same release number as the package as
needed.

This will produce a Slackware compatible .txz package.  The exact
version number in the package filename will depend on the version
of Google Chrome found in the .deb package, but it will be something
like:  inspec-2.1.67-x86_64-1zakame.txz

You'll find the output package in the /tmp directory.


Then, install the package (again as root):

cd /tmp
upgradepkg --install-new inspec-2.1.67-x86_64-1zakame.txz

Do note that if you have a chefdk package installed, this inspec package
will overwrite the /usr/bin/inspec symlink installed by the chefdk
package.


Enjoy!  :-)
